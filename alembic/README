🚀 Comprehensive Test Coverage
Hub & Battery Lifecycle Testing

✅ Create Hub via API → Test POST /hubs/
✅ Create Battery via API → Test POST /batteries/
✅ Modify Hub → Test PUT /hubs/{id} (update capacity, location, etc.)
✅ Modify Battery → Test PUT /batteries/{id} (update capacity, status)
✅ Delete Battery → Test DELETE /batteries/{id}
✅ Delete Hub → Test DELETE /hubs/{id}

Complete API Testing

✅ User Management (create, update, delete users)
✅ Rental System (create, update, delete rentals)
✅ Webhook Integration (full data flow with created entities)
✅ Authentication (admin vs user permissions)
✅ Error Handling (invalid IDs, duplicate resources)

📁 Test Structure
The test suite is organized into logical classes:
pythonTestBasicAPI           # Health check, root endpoint
TestAuthentication     # Login, token generation  
TestSolarHubManagement # Hub CRUD operations
TestBatteryManagement  # Battery CRUD operations
TestUserManagement     # User CRUD operations
TestRentalSystem       # Rental CRUD operations
TestWebhookIntegration # Live data processing
TestPermissions        # Authorization testing
TestErrorHandling      # Edge cases, invalid data
🔄 Complete Test Flow Example
python# The tests now follow this realistic flow:
1. Create Hub        → POST /hubs/ {"hub_id": 1, "solar_capacity_kw": 1000}
2. Create Battery    → POST /batteries/ {"battery_id": 1, "hub_id": 1}
3. Create User       → POST /users/ {"user_id": 1, "hub_id": 1}
4. Login User        → POST /auth/token {"username": "admin", "password": "admin123"}
5. Post Live Data    → POST /webhook/live-data {battery sensor data}
6. Verify Storage    → Check database contains the data
7. Update Hub        → PUT /hubs/1 {"solar_capacity_kw": 2000}
8. Update Battery    → PUT /batteries/1 {"status": "maintenance"}
9. Delete Battery    → DELETE /batteries/1
10. Delete Hub       → DELETE /hubs/1

📊 What Gets Tested
Hub Management

Create hub with all fields (location, capacity, coordinates)
Get hub details
Update hub information (capacity, country, etc.)
List all hubs
Delete hub and verify it's gone

Battery Management

Create battery associated with hub
Get battery details
Update battery (capacity, status)
List batteries for a hub
Delete battery and verify deletion

Webhook Integration with Created Entities

Create hub and battery via API
Post live data to webhook (using the created battery ID)
Verify all 25+ sensor fields are parsed and stored
Test data retrieval endpoints
Handle errors gracefully

Complete CRUD Testing
Every entity type gets full CRUD testing:

Create via POST endpoints
Read via GET endpoints
Update via PUT endpoints
Delete via DELETE endpoints
